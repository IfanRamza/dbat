- Fix xml camera model
- Fix binary formats
- Fix image-variant stuff
- Fix Image observation weights
  - At input?
  - As an operation
  - prior EO, OP => compute weight from gsd
  - prior IO, compute weight from radial distance
  - in mesurement file, include quality parameter(s), use function to compute wieght


- IDeas:
  - Given IO, EO, simulate observations, estimate post cov
