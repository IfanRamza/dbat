- Fix xml camera model to hide -y transformation.
- Fix binary formats.
- Fix image-variant stuff.
- Fix Image observation weights
  - At input?
  - As an operation
  - prior EO, OP => compute weight from gsd
  - prior IO, compute weight from radial distance
  - in mesurement file, include quality parameter(s), use function to compute wieght
- Add ranges to ctrl point filtering.
- Add std override for ctrl, check pts.

- IDeas:
  - Given IO, EO, simulate observations, estimate post cov

- Pass meta XML to report file
