  abstract =	 {According to the Waldhausl and Ogleby (1994) "3x3
                  rules", a well-designed close-range architectural
                  photogrammetric project should include a sketch of
                  the project site with the approximate position and
                  viewing direction of each image. This orientation
                  metadata is important to determine which part of the
                  object each image covers. In principle, the metadata
                  could be used as initial values for the camera
                  external orientation (EO) parameters. However, this
                  has rarely been used, partly due to convergence
                  problem for the bundle adjustment procedure.  In
                  this paper we present a photogrammetric
                  reconstruction pipeline based on classical methods
                  and investigate if and how the linesearch bundle
                  algorithm of Borlin et al. (2004) and/or metadata
                  can be used to aid the reconstruction process in
                  architectural photogrammetry when the classical
                  methods fail.  The primary initial values for the
                  bundle are calculated by the five-point algorithm by
                  Nist{\'e}r (Stewenius et al., 2006). Should the
                  bundle fail, initial values derived from metadata
                  are calculated and used for a second bundle attempt.
                  The pipeline was evaluated on an image set of the
                  INSA building in Strasbourg. The data set includes
                  mixed convex and non-convex subnetworks and a
                  combination of manual and automatic measurements.
                  The results show that, in general, the classical
                  bundle algorithm with five-point initial values
                  worked well. However, in cases where it did fail,
                  linesearch bundle and/or metadata initial values did
                  help. The presented approach is interesting for
                  solving EO problems when the automatic orientation
                  processes fail as well as to simplify keeping a link
                  between the metadata containing the plan of how the
                  project should have become and the actual
                  reconstructed network as it turned out to be.},

                  as an optimisation problem and shown to be
                  equivalent to the undamped Gauss–Newton (GN)
                  optimisation method. Three problem-independent
                  damping modifications of the GN method are
                  presented: the line search method of Armijo (GNA);
                  the Levenberg– Marquardt algorithm (LM); and
                  Levenberg–Marquardt with Powell dogleg (LMP).
                  Furthermore, an additional problem-specific "veto"
                  damping technique, based on the chirality condition,
                  is suggested. In a perturbation study on a
                  terrestrial bundle adjustment problem, the GNA and
                  LMP methods with veto damping can increase the size
                  of the pull-in region compared to the undamped
                  method; the LM method showed less improvement. The
                  results suggest that damped methods can, in many
                  cases, provide a solution where undamped methods
                  fail and should be available in any LSA software
                  package. Matlab code for the algorithms discussed is
                  available from the authors.},

                  point perspective pose estimation problems are
                  reviewed from a unified perspective beginning with
                  the first solution which was published in 1841 by a
                  German mathematician, continuing through the
                  solutions published in the German and then American
                  photogrammetry literature, and most recently in the
                  current computer vision literature. The numerical
                  stability of these three point perspective solutions
                  are also discussed. We show that even in case where
                  the solution is not near the geometric unstable
                  region, considerable care must be exercised in the
                  calculation. Depending on the order of the
                  substitutions utilized, the relative error can
                  change over a thousand to one. This difference is
                  due entirely to the way the calculations are
                  performed and not due to any geometric structural
                  instability of any problem instance. We present an
                  analysis method which produces a numerically stable
