      Project Problems (2)
         Problem: The following cameras are not calibrated: 2013.
            Suggestion: For best results you should use fully calibrated cameras. If you are having accuracy problems, you should calibrate your camera (it is easy and does not take long - See Camera Calibration in the User Manual).
         Problem: You have one or more points with angle thresholds lower than 30 degrees
            Suggestion: Points with low angle separation will not solve with good accuracy. If possible add a photo with greater angle separation.
