         Problem: The following cameras are not calibrated: Canon EOS 7D [20.00].
            Suggestion: For best results you should use fully calibrated cameras. If you are having accuracy problems, you should calibrate your camera (it is easy and does not take long - See Camera Calibration in the User Manual).
         Problem: A large percentage of your points are sub-pixel marked so it is assumed you are striving for a high accuracy result. The largest residual (Point6 - 2.10) is greater than 1.00 pixels. 
            Suggestion: In high accuracy projects, strive to get all point residuals under 1.00 pixels. If you have just a few high residual points, study them on each photo to ensure they are marked and referenced correctly. If many of your points have high residuals then make sure the camera stations are solving correctly. Ensure that you are using the best calibrated camera possible. Remove points that have been manually marked unless you need them.
