#    [list]
#
# 2) If you use the code for commercial work, you should acknowledge the
#    use by including the phrase "Uses code from the Damped Bundle
#    Adjustment Toolbox v0.2.0." in an About box or similar.
#
# 3) If you port algorithms from the toolbox to other applications,
#    you should acknowledge the fact by including a statement "Uses
#    algorithms from the Damped Bundle Adjustment Toolbox v0.2.0." in
#    an About box or similar.
