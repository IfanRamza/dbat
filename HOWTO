# This file contains examples of how to use the Damped Bundle Adjustment
# Toolbox (DBAT) v0.1 for Matlab.

# Currently, the only implementation of data import is via exported text
# files from Photomodeler, with two modifications.

# IMPORTING PHOTOMODELER PROJECTS INTO THE DBAT.
#
# To import a Photomodeler project into the toolbox, the following
# steps are valid in Photomodeler Scanner 2012:
#
# 1) Export the project using Export Text File. If the Export Text File
#    option is not available, follow the ENABLE TEXT FILE EXPORT IN
#    PHOTOMODELER instructions below.
# 2) After export, open the generated text file in a text editor.
# 2a) On the second row (usually reading 0.00005 20), append the width and
#     height in pixels of your images.
# 2b) On the fourth row, update the camera parameters.




# ENABLE TEXT FILE EXPORT IN PHOTOMODELER
# =======================================
#
# Some versions of Photomodeler do not have the text file export option
# enabled by default. In that case, follow the following steps to enable it:
# a) Right-click on the main window toolbar, select Customize toolbar...
# b) In the Commands tab, select the File category.
# c) Drag the 'Export Text File...' command to a toolbar of your choice.
# d) Now you should be able to export your project as a text file by
#    clicking on the Export Text File button.
